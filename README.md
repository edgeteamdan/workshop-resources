## Workshop Project: Jarvis AI Assistant

Build a Telegram-based personal AI assistant named "Jarvis" (inspired by Iron Man's AI) using the agent_stack blueprint.

### Architecture Requirements

- **ONE** Mastra Agent containing all business logic and tools
- **ONE** Mastra Workflow with exactly TWO steps:
  1. Step 1: Call `agent.generate()` only (no other logic)
  2. Step 2: Send response to Telegram only (no other logic)
- Telegram trigger registered to call the workflow on new messages

### Agent Configuration

- **Name:** "Jarvis - Personal AI Assistant"
- **Model:** Use Replit AI Integrations with GPT-5 (no API key required, billed to credits)
  - Follow the OpenAI AI Integrations blueprint setup for Mastra/Agent Stack
- **Memory:** PostgreSQL-backed conversation memory with thread support
  - `generateTitle: true`
  - `lastMessages: 20`
- **Personality:** Professional yet personable assistant, efficient, occasionally witty, prioritizes user needs

### Three Required Tools

#### 1. Google Calendar Tool
- Read upcoming events from user's Google Calendar
- Create new calendar events with attendee invites
- Use Google Calendar integration

#### 2. Gmail Tool
- Draft emails in user's Gmail account
- Use Gmail integration

#### 3. Research Tool
- Use Exa search API (`exa-js` package already installed) for high-quality semantic web searches
- Ask for `EXA_API_KEY` secret and store it securely
- Perform semantic searches using `exa.searchAndContents()` method
- Combine Exa results with AI's built-in knowledge
- Provide summaries with sources and direct URLs to content

### Deployment Fix (CRITICAL)

Modify `scripts/build.sh` to include:
```bash
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096"
```
before `exec mastra build` to prevent memory errors during deployment.

### Telegram Integration

- Bot responds to direct messages and mentions
- React with hourglass emoji when processing
- Use Telegram HTTP API for sending messages
- Thread ID format: `telegram/{chatId}`

### Extensive Logging

- Add detailed logger statements throughout all tools, agent, and workflow steps
- Use emojis in logs (üîß, üìù, ‚úÖ, ‚ùå, etc.) for easy tracking
- After building, test the agent in the Playground tab, then suggest deployment
- Make sure the bot will work immediately after deployment without "AI SDK v4 compatibility" errors
